# My Linux Installation

This repository is a reference to me install all softwares I normally use in my Linux enviroment. Fell free to use, modificate and suggest changes.

It's now updated to Linux Mint 20 "Ulyana", using only apt packages and flatpak packages provided by flathub.

Still need testing, but should work fine.
