# My Linux Installation

It's now updated to Linux Mint 20 "Ulyana"

It's a work in progress but must install all the softwares fine...I guess.

This repository is a reference to me install all softwares I normally use in my Linux enviroment. Fell free to use, modificate and suggest changes.

Using flatpak packages provided by flathub.
